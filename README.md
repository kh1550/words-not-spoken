# Words Not Spoken | Kristin Ho

* You can check that Play (as an iterator) and Scene classes are working by running novel.py
* You can check that Flask and CSV modules code are functional by running main.py
* You can check that Character class is working by looping through chars and printing each item in initialize()
* Scene and Play classes are not yet integrated with the Flask app
* Upon starting the Flask app, you can visit localhost:5000 and click PLAY which will redirect you to where gameplay would be

### Modules Used
* Flask	0.10.1
* Jinja2 2.8
* MarkupSafe 0.23
* Werkzeug 0.11.8
* itsdangerous 0.24
* pip 7.1.0
* setuptools 18.1

### Notes
* The game's story isn't presented from the beginning, so there are parts missing. I've tried to add some backstory.
* Currently, there are no choices available. I wasn't able to flesh out all the choices there maybe could have had.
* Just click the textbox area or refresh to progress the story.
* I wasn't able to ensure that the window would display correctly on all platforms, so fingers crossed! might be a bit wonky.
