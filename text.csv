3,1,NARR,"You will inevitably have to talk to MeiXin again.",MEIYOU,None,None,static/img/classroom.png
3,1,NARR,"Remember that she made you do the bulk of your iOS project last year. Remember that you wrote the entire play for Japanese project because she was too 'busy'.

3,2,NARR,"But outside of class and lunch, she usually only messages you to ask for homework help. Sometimes she also complains about her boyfriend.

But you want to be a good friend so you listen and give her the best advice you can offer.",MEIYOU,None,None,static/img/home.png
3,3,NARR,"The semester went well. You even had KBBQ and karaoke with MeiXin and your friends Curtis and Noah. You had a few rough patches; though you and MeiXin were partners for Principles of Programming Languages, you ended up doing most of the work each week. Even when you were sick with a 102 F fever, and she said that she would do the heavy lifting for the assignment due that day, you ended up writing the whole assignment by yourself for the two of you. Worse, the final assignment was due on the opening night of the new Star Wars film. She never liked Star Wars until she met her boyfriend because he liked the series. She decided that she would submit the homework late which meant you had to do it all by yourself. You couldn't finish and handed it in incomplete. She asked someone else for help and handed it in the next day.",MEIYOU,None,None,static/img/home.png

3,3,NARR,"You try not to scream. She only took 3 classes this semester, and you had gotten no sleep because you were taking 4 and you live 2 hours away. It was pitch black when you had left your house that morning.",MEIYOU,None,None,static/img/classroom.png

4,1,NARR,"Your winter break went by without much contact with anyone. You invited MeiXin to visit a cat cafe during break but she never followed through.

4,2,NARR,"At the beginning of the semester, you just sit on the opposite of MeiXin and try to ignore he's there. You make small talk if you have to. You might as well, since you and MeiXin have the same exact four classes this semester.",MEIYOU,None,None,static/img/classroom.png
4,2,NARR,"But the semester doesn't go very smoothly. To start, she makes you eat with KC everyday. Not only that, she makes you wait another 2 hours to eat so that you can eat with him.",MEIYOU,None,None,static/img/nyu.png
4,2,NARR,"But it only gets worse. One of those days you're waiting for him, you and MeiXin are doing homework for a 400 level class. KC has only taken Intro to Computer Programming. Both you and MeiXin are in your fourth year of computer science. While you and MeiXin disagree on an answer to your homework, you both disagree to KC's answer. But he won't stop. He continues to argue and push that his answer is right even as you are walking to grab food. He doesn't respect MeiXin's or your expertise despite your four years of study.",MEIYOU,None,None,static/img/nyu.png
4,2,NARR,"It comes to a point where you can't stand having to be around him. No matter what you or MeiXin says, he disagrees and refuses to agree to disagree. Worse yet, he throws shade at MeiXin in front of you thinking you have no idea how he bullies her for not wanting to work on his startup idea. You refuse to eat with them anymore, even though you will be eating alone for the first time in 7 months.",MEIYOU,None,None,static/img/nyu.png

4,3,NARR,"Has this not always been the case?",None,None,None,black
4,3,NARR,"Then you realize. You have the same 4 classes as her. You have the same exact workload. Except you have a job, she does not. Except you live 2 hours away, she lives 15 minutes away. If you have time to do your job, do homework, and commute 4 hours a day, for what reason should she need to ask for your homework when she has the same workload?",None,None,None,static/img/home.png
4,3,NARR,"At the same time, she doesn't hang out with you. She doesn't hear your troubles. She only messages you when she needs help but not once has she ever helped you.",MEIYOU,None,None,static/img/home.png
